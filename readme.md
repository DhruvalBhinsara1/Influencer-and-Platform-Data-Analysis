# Social Media Influencer Data Analysis

Welcome to the Social Media Influencer Data Analysis project. This repository provides a transparent, stepwise approach to understanding influencer marketing performance using real-world data. The workflow is designed for clarity, reproducibility, and actionable insight, making it suitable for both business stakeholders and data professionals.

## Project Overview

This project explores influencer marketing data across multiple platforms, focusing on engagement, revenue, and campaign effectiveness. The analysis pipeline includes:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of trends and patterns
- Generation of actionable business insights

## Dataset Summary

The dataset includes:

- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Financial data (revenue generated, ad spend)
- Follower counts and demographics
- Platform, region, brand, and category information

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: This repository uses a completely synthetic dataset created for demonstration and educational purposes only. Any names, brands, follower counts, metrics, events, or other data that may resemble real individuals, organizations, or happenings are purely coincidental and not deliberate. Do not use this data for production decisions or to represent real people or companies.

## Analysis Stages & Deliverables

1. **Data Cleaning**  
	- Remove missing values, standardize formats, unify currencies, and ensure data integrity.  
	- Output: `data/cleaned_dataset.csv`, `notebooks/01_data_cleaning.ipynb`

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
	- Understand data structure, distributions, and relationships.  
	- Output: `notebooks/02_eda_visualization.ipynb`, summary plots in `notebooks/results/`

3. **Trend Analysis & Visualization**  
	- Identify time-based and category-based trends, ROI, and campaign drivers.  
	- Output: `notebooks/03_trend_analysis.ipynb`, advanced plots in `notebooks/results/`

4. **Reporting**  
	- Summarize findings and recommendations for business strategy.  
	- Output: (see `tasks_and_deliverables.txt` for details)
